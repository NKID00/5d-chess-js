## Demo

Live demo on JSFiddle available [here](https://jsfiddle.net/alexbay218/57drakwg/)

## Installation

### Node.js

Simply install with this command `npm i 5d-chess-js`

To use the library, here is a simple 3 action checkmate example here:

``` js
const Chess = require('5d-chess-js');
var chess = new Chess();
chess.move('e3');
chess.submit();
chess.move('f6');
chess.submit();
chess.move('Qe2');
chess.submit();
chess.move('Nc6');
chess.submit();
chess.move('Qh5');
chess.submit();
chess.print();
console.log(chess.inCheckmate);
```

### In Browser

Include this tag in the HTML before invoking the library:
``` html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/5d-chess-js/dist/5d-chess.js"></script>
```

To use the library, the `Chess` class is exposed in the global scope. Here is the same 3 action checkmate example for in browser use.

``` js
var chess = new Chess();
chess.move('e3');
chess.submit();
chess.move('f6');
chess.submit();
chess.move('Qe2');
chess.submit();
chess.move('Nc6');
chess.submit();
chess.move('Qh5');
chess.submit();
chess.print();
console.log(chess.inCheckmate);
```

## Supported Variants

Currently supported variants:

 - Standard - This uses the standard chess layout (the string literal `standard` is used internally).
 - Defended Pawn - This variant switches the queen and queenside knight (the string literal `Standard - Defended Pawn` is used internally).
 - Half Reflected - This variant switches the black queen and black king (the string literal `half_reflected` is used internally).
 - Princess - This variant replaces the queen with a princess, a piece that only has rook + bishop movement (the string literal `princess` is used internally). Note the SAN piece equivalent is `S`.
 - Turn Zero - This variant adds a new black 'Turn Zero' board to allow black to timetravel on first action (the string literal `turn_zero` is used internally).

## Terminology

Terms used in the notation of 5D Chess JS:

  - Move - A move is considered as a single movement of a piece (Capturing, En Passant, and Castling are considered a single move).
  - Action - A collection of moves that when submitted results in other player's time to play.
  - Action Number - A number starting from 1 that indicates both the current player and how many actions has been taken. Increments by 1 every time an action is played
  - Turn - A movable dimension within the game. A single turn has both white and black actions.
  - Timeline - A movable dimension within the game. Timelines contain multiple boards across turns.
  - Rank - A movable dimension within the game. Same as standard chess.
  - File - A movable dimension within the game. Same as standard chess.
  - Full Board - A full board is considered as the full board state between actions. Contains all timelines, turns, and singular chessboards with all pieces.

## PGN

5D Chess JS uses the `5dpgn` standard as defined [here](https://github.com/adri326/5dchess-notation). Previous versions (v0.3.6 and below) used an older custom notation system.
This library still maintains backwards compatibility, but `5dpgn` is the preferred standard moving forward.

For information on the old notation system see [here](./notation.old.md).

## FEN

If you wish to have your own, custom variants, then you may format them using the included 5DFEN format.
Its grammar can be found at [fen.ebnf](https://github.com/adri326/5dchess-notation/blob/master/fen.ebnf).

5DFEN lets you define custom variants and starting positions by specifying the initial boards' layout instead of giving it a "variant" metadata tag.
The boards that emerge from previous board after a possible move are then described using this library's movement notation.

A *board string* is the 5DFEN way of describing the state of an initial board.
A board string is enclosed within square brackets (`[]`) and is made of several fields, separated by colons (`:`).
There should be no spaces, as to not confuse a board string with a regular header.

The first field contains the board's pieces:
- The different rows of the board are separated by slashes (`/`), the rows are read from top to bottom.
- Each row is a string of pieces - encoded using letters (optionally followed by a `+`) - and blanks - encoded using numbers.
- A white piece is encoded as an uppercase letter and a black piece as a lowercase letter.
- To extend the number of pieces that can be encoded without sacrificing readability, a piece's corresponding letter may be followed
by a `+`.

This is the list of the available pieces that you may put in a 5DFEN board string:
- `P/p` for [p]awn
- `B/b` for [b]ishop
- `R/r` for [r]ook
- `N/n` for k[n]ight
- `K/k` for [k]ing
- `Q/q` for [q]ueen
- ~~`U/u` for [u]nicorn~~ (not yet available)
- ~~`D/d` for [d]ragon~~ (not yet available)
- `S/s` for prince[s]s
- ~~`W/w` for bra[w]n~~ (not yet available)
- ~~`C/c` for [c]ommon king~~ (not yet available)
- ~~`Q+/q+` for royal [q]ueen~~ (not yet available)

Blanks are encoded using numbers:
- If there is a one-piece blank, then it is encoded using `1`.
- If there is a two-piece blank, then it is encoded using `2`.
- If there is a ten-piece blank, then it is encoded using `10.
- If there is a N-piece blank, then it is encoded by writing `N` out in base 10.

If a piece is sensitive to having been moved already or not and hasn't moved yet, then it must be followed by an asterisk (`*`):
- An unmoved white pawn is encoded as `P*`
- An unmoved black king is encoded as `k*`

If `+` and `*` need to be combined, then `+` comes first: `q+*`.

The other three fields are:
- Timeline, may be `-1`, `-0`, `0`, `+0`, `+1`, etc.
- Turn, as displayed in-game, may be `0`, `1`, `2`, etc.
- Player color, may be `w` for white and `b` for black

#### Required metadata

The following metadata fields are required to have within the headers of a game using 5DFEN:

- `Board = "Custom"`, as to indicate that 5DFEN needs to be used
- `Size = "WxH"`, with `W` the width of the boards and `H` the height of the boards
- `Puzzle = "Mate-in-N"`, with `N` the number of actions to be made by the current player. This is only required if the position is meant
  as a puzzle and where a mate in N is possible. Other kinds of puzzles may also be encoded in a similar way.

#### 5DFEN Examples:

This is how the standard position would be encoded:

```fen
[size "8x8"]
[board "custom"]
[r*nbqk*bnr*/p*p*p*p*p*p*p*p*/8/8/8/8/P*P*P*P*P*P*P*P*/R*NBQK*BNR*:0:1:w]
```

This is how `Rook Tactics I` would be encoded:

```fen
[size "5x5"]
[board "custom"]
[puzzle "mate-in-1"]
[4k/5/5/5/K1R:0:1:w]

1. Kb2 / Ke4
2. Re1 / Kd3
```

## API

### Constructor

**Chess([import, variant])**

Creates a new instance of the `Chess` class.

  - import - *[Optional]* List of actions to import. Can be `5dpgn` string (delimited by newline characters, either `\n` or `\r\n`), array of `Action` objects, or JSON string of an array of `Action` objects.
  - variant = *[Optional]* String of variant to use. Also accepts `Board` object for custom variant.
  - **Return** - A new `Chess` object.

### Fields

These fields are implemented as a getter function. If getter functions are unsupported on the platform, call these fields as a function instead (example `.board` becomes `.board()`).

**.board**

  - **Return** - Current full board state as a `Board` object.

**.actionNumber**

  - **Return** - Current action number as an integer.

**.boardHistory**

  - **Return** - Array of `Board` objects representing all past and current full boards.

**.actionHistory**

  - **Return** - Array of `Action` objects representing all past actions played by both players during the whole game.

**.moveBuffer**

  - **Return** - Array of `Move` objects representing all current moves played by the current player before submitting.

**.player**

  - **Return** - String (either `"white"` or `"black"`) representing the current player.

**.inCheck**

  - **Return** - Boolean indicating if the current board state has the current player in check.

**.inCheckmate**

  - **Return** - Boolean indicating if the current board state has the current player in checkmate (i.e. current player loses).

**.inStalemate**

  - **Return** - Boolean indicating if the current board state has the current player in stalemate.

**.hash**

  - **Return** - String of md5 hash of the board data.

**.checkmateTimeout**

  - **Return** - Number indicating milliseconds for the max time the checkmate detection can run, this value is writable (Note: This is an actual internal variable and not a getter function). By default set to 1 minute.
  
**.skipDetection**

  - **Return** - Boolean indicating whether to skip validation and checkmate detection, this value is writable (Note: This is an actual internal variable and not a getter function). Default value is false. Primarily used for engine purposes (to reduce CPU waste).

### Functions

**.import(import, [variant])**

Imports data to have the internal state match the state that the imported data represents. Since the imported data is a list of actions from the start of the game (accessible through **.actionHistory** or **.export()**), this function effectively replays all actions to arrive at the desired internal state. Action/Move validation occurs at each step, so performance may suffer if the imported data represents a large full board state. Will throw errors.

  - import - List of actions to import (this will reset the internal state). Can be `5dpgn` string (delimited by newline characters, either `\n` or `\r\n`), array of `Action` objects, or JSON string of an array of `Action` objects.
  - variant = *[Optional]* String of variant to use. Also accepts `Board` object for custom variant.
  - **Return** - Nothing.

**.importable(import)**

Check if the imported data is valid and can be imported. Does not modify internal state and will not throw errors.

  - import - List of actions to import (this will reset the internal state). Can be `5dpgn` string (delimited by newline characters, either `\n` or `\r\n`), array of `Action` objects, or JSON string of an array of `Action` objects.
  - **Return** - Boolean representing if the imported data is valid and can be imported.

**.fen()**

Get the 5DFEN string of the starting board.

  - **Return** - String containing 5DFEN of the starting board.

**.fen(fen)**

Modify the current board with the 5DFEN string.

  - fen - String containing 5DFEN to apply to the current board.
  - **Return** - Nothing.

**.fenable(fen)**

Check if the 5DFEN string is valid and can be applied. Does not modify internal state and will not throw errors.

  - fen - String containing 5DFEN to apply to the current board.
  - **Return** - Boolean representing if the 5DFEN string is valid and can be applied.

**.reset([variant])**

Resets the internal state to the initial full board state.

  - variant - *[Optional]* String of variant to use. Also accepts `Board` object for custom variant.
  - **Return** - Nothing.

**.copy()**

Creates a new instance of the Chess class with the exact same internal state.

  - **Return** - New Chess class instance.

### Schemas

These schemas define the various object types that the API interacts with.

**Position**

``` js
{
  timeline: Integer,                                          // Timeline number of the position, 0 is neutral, negative integers are for black and positive integers are for white.
  turn: Integer,                                              // Turn number of the position, starts from 1.
  player: String Enum ['white','black'],                      // Indicates the player that the turn belongs to.
  coordinate: String SAN Coordinate ['(a-h)(1-8)'),           // SAN Coordinate of the rank and file of this position. This field is not required when used as an input.
  rank: Integer,                                              // Rank number of the position, range is from 1 to 8 (same as rank component of a SAN Coordinate).
  file: Integer                                               // File number of the position, range is from 1 to 8 (a = 1, b = 2, etc).

```

**Move**

``` js

**Board**

``` js
{
  action: Integer,                                            // Action number of the player that is making the next action.
  player: String Enum ['white','black'],                      // Indicates the player that is making the next action.
  width: Integer                                              // Indicates the width of the boards within the full board.
  height: Integer                                             // Indicates the height of the boards within the full board.
  timelines: Array,                                           // Array of Timeline Objects

## Internal Raw Format

This library had a previous first attempt. It had a more traditional object-based format similar to the `Board` object format. This resulted in terrible performance, especially in generating actions.
This version uses a 4D array to store the full board state, with numbers as the piece indicator.

Here is the format: `board[timeline][turn][rank][file] = piece`
  - Timeline: starts from 0 (0, +1, +2, +3 => 0, 2, 4, 6 and -1, -2, -3 => 1, 3, 5)
  - Turn: starts from 0 (white player: 1, 2, 3 => 0, 2, 4 and black player: 1, 2, 3 => 1, 3, 5)
  - Rank: starts from 0 (1, 2, 3 => 0, 1, 2)
  - File: start from 0 (a, b, c => 0, 1, 2)
  - Piece (negative value indicates piece is unmoved):
    - Pawn: (white player: 2 and black player: 1)
    - Bishop: (white player: 4 and black player: 3)
    - Knight: (white player: 6 and black player: 5)
    - Rook: (white player: 8 and black player: 7)
    - Queen: (white player: 10 and black player: 9)
    - King: (white player: 12 and black player: 11)
    - Princess: (white player: 14 and black player: 13)


## FAQ

### Is it any good?

Yes (maybe).

### You incorrectly evaluated this full board as a checkmate (or not a checkmate)!

If you can provide me an action list (object, json, or notation) or the full board state, and submit it as an issue, I can get right on it. This goes for any other bugs. A good way to verify if it is correct or not is to repeat the same moves in the same order in '5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel' and see if it matches this library.

### Why is this on GitLab instead of GitHub?

I made the switch from GitHub to GitLab mid 2019 when I was starting a new long term project called KSS. Back then, GitHub did not have many of the features it does now, such as integrated CI/CD and more. GitLab was the superior product in almost every way. Furthermore, as a believer in the open source, it seem ironic that open source software would be hosted on closed source platforms. With GitLab being open source, I can be sure that if GitLab.org crumbles, I can still maintain the overall project structure via GitLab instances. This allows me to preserve the Git repo itself, but also the issues, labels, rules, pipelines, etc. that are fundamental to a project. With GitHub, developers do not have this guarantee and they also do not have full control over their project structure.

### Isn't the game copyrighted?

Yes, the game '5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel' is under copyright by Thunkspace, LLC and any source code, written works, and other copyrightable materials are the property of Thunkspace, LLC. However, copyright does not extend to an idea, which include game rules. So as long as the new work does not contain a direct copy of the rules or other material within the original game. Well known precedent for this is Hasbro's lawsuit against Scrabulous in which they dropped it after Scrabulous removed material that could possible be considered violating copyright (https://www.cnet.com/news/hasbro-drops-scrabulous-lawsuit/).

Also of note is this article from the American Bar Association (https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2014-15/march-april/its_how_you_play_game_why_videogame_rules_are_not_expression_protected_copyright_law/).

5D Chess JS in no way aims to violate any copyright laws, but instead aims to be an open source implementation of the original ideas as presented by '5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel'.
